What is Core Java?

Core Java refers to the fundamental components and libraries of the Java programming language, emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

It constitutes the base language features without advanced functionalities. Core Java serves as a foundation for more specialized Java applications.
Java Editions

The Java Programming Language supports distinct editions, each catering to specific development needs:

1. Java ME (Java Micro Edition):

Java ME, the micro edition, is tailored for developing mobile phone applications. It provides a streamlined framework for creating applications designed for mobile devices. As such, Java ME is the preferred choice for developers venturing into mobile application development. 2) Java SE (Java Standard Edition):

Java SE serves as a computing-based platform primarily utilized for crafting desktop or Windows-based applications. Core Java constitutes an integral part of Java SE, enabling developers to create desktop applications using fundamental Java concepts. The Java Development Kit (JDK) serves as a well-known Java SE implementation in this context. 3) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):

Also recognized as Java 2 Platform or J2EE, Java EE is the enterprise platform designed for server-based application development, emphasizing enterprise-level projects. This edition is specifically employed for web development, facilitating the creation of robust and scalable server-side applications.
